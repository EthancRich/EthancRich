- 👋 Hi, I’m @EthancRich
- 👀 I’m interested in creating projects in order to learn and develop the skills taught along my journey toward a CS degree.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more programming languages like JavaScript, C++, Python, and others.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on projects just yet, but I am open to suggestions and input on my projects.
