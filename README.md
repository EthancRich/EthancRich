- 👋 Hi, I’m @EthancRich
- 👀 I’m interested in creating projects in order to learn and develop the skills taught along my journey toward a CS degree.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced Java systems like JavaFX, and also dipping my toes into Python.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on projects just yet, but I am open to suggestions and input on my projects.
- 📫 You can reach me by email: ethanc.rich@gmail.com
